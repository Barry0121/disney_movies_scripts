<blockquote>
<i>
A Chinese painting of the Great Wall of China is slowly painted across
the screen. The words Walt Disney Pictures present and then Mulan and
the dragon symbol appear. The painting becomes animated, and a Chinese
soldier walks around his post. Suddenly, a bird of prey hits the back
of his head ...
</i>

<dl>
<dt> <b>Soldier</b>: <dd> Ah! <i>[The hawk lets out a call. The soldier walks over to the edge of the wall. A hook comes flying up, followed by many more.]</i>
<dt> <b>Soldier</b>: <dd> <i>[Running back to his post]</i> We're under attack! Light the signal!
</dl>

<blockquote>
<i>
The door opens, revealing a couple of Huns. The soldier climbs up the ladder.
</i>
</blockquote>

<dl>
<dt> <b>Soldier</b>: <dd> <i>[lighting the signal with a torch, while staring at the Hun leader; other signals go on all the way along the Great Wall]</i> Now all of China knows you're here.
<dt> <b>Shan Yu</b>: <dd> <i>[picking up a flag and toasting it in the signal fire]</i> Perfect.

The Chinese General and two soldiers walk into the Emperor's chamber and bow.

<dl>
<dt> <b>General</b>: <dd> Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern Border.
<dt> <b>Chi Fu</b>: <dd> Impossible! No one can get through the Great Wall! <i>[He is silenced with a raised hand from the Emperor]</i>
<dt> <b>General</b>: <dd> Shan Yu is leading them. We'll set up defenses around your palace immediately.
<dt> <b>Emperor</b>: <dd> No! <i>[Standing up]</i> Send your troops to protect my people! Chi Fu!
<dt> <b>Chi Fu</b>: <dd> Yes, your Highness.
<dt> <b>Emperor</b>: <dd> Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces. Call up reserves, and as many new recruits as possible.
<dt> <b>General</b>: <dd> Forgive me, your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.
<dt> <b>Emperor</b>: <dd> I won't take any chances, General. A single grain of rice can tip the scale; one man may be the difference between victory and defeat.

Quiet and demure ... graceful, polite, delicate, refined, poised ...<br>
<i>[she picks up a paintbrush and makes a mark on her arm]</i> ... punctual!<br>
<i>[A rooster crows]</i> Aaiee!<br>
<i>[Blowing on her arm]</i> Little brother! Little brother! Little-- <i>[she glances down at a sleeping dog on the floor]</i><br>
Ah! There you are! <i>[The dog wakes up]</i><br>
Who's the smartest doggy in the world? C'mon, smart boy! Can you help me with my chores today? <i>[she ties a sack of chicken feed to his back, complete with a pole and a bone attached. Little Brother immediately chases the bone, running promptly into a wall and then out the door, scattering grain everywhere.]</i>
<dt> <b>Fa Zu</b>: <dd> <i>[praying]</i> Honorable Ancestors ... please help Mulan impress the Matchmaker today.
<i>[Little Brother, followed by a herd of chickens, bursts into the family temple.]</i> Please, please help her.
<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> Father, I brought you some ... Whoop! <i>[bangs into Fa Zu, he catches the tea pot on his cane while the cups hit the ground and shatter]</i>
<dt> <b>Fa Zu</b>: <dd> Mulan ...
<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> I brought a spare!
<dt> <b>Fa Zu</b>: <dd> Mulan ...
<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning ...
<dt> <b>Fa Zu</b>: <dd> Mulan.
<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> ... and three at night.
<dt> <b>Fa Zu</b>: <dd> Mulan. You should already be in town. We're counting on you to ...
<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> Uphold the family honor. Don't worry, Father. I won't let you down. Wish me luck!

<dt> <b>Fa Li</b>: <dd> Of all the days to be late! I should have prayed to the ancestors for luck.
<dt> <b>Granny Fa</b>: <dd> How lucky can they be? They're dead. Besides, I've got all the luck we'll need. <i>[Holds up a wicker cage with a cricket inside.]</i> This is your chance to prove yourself. <i>[She closes her eyes and steps off the sidewalk.]</i>

     We're going to turn this sow's ear<br>

<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> It's freezing!
<dt> <b>Fa Li</b>: <dd> It would've been warm, if you were here on time.
<dt> <b>Woman #1</b>: <dd> We'll have you, washed and dried<br>

     Great honor in one way<br>

     A pendant for balance<br>
     Beads of jade for beauty<br>
     You must proudly show it<br>
     Now, add a cricket, just for luck,<br>
     And even you can't blow it!<br>

<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> Ancestors, hear my plea,<br>
     Please don't let me make a fool of me<br>
     And to not uproot my family tree<br>
     Keep my father standing tall.<br>
     <p>
     Scarier than the Undertaker,<br>
     We are meeting our matchmaker!<br>
     Destiny, guard our girls,<br>
     Help our future as it fast unfurls<br>
     Please look kindly on these cultured pearls<br>
     Each a perfect porcelain doll ...<br>

<dt> <b>Matchmaker</b>: <dd> Well?
<dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> Fulfill your duties, calmly and ... <i>[glances down at the crib notes written on her arm, which are smeared slightly]</i> respectively. Um, reflect before you ... snack. Act! This shall bring you honor and glory. <i>[She fans herself, the matchmaker grabs the fan and searches it for cheat notes. Finding none, she grabs Mulan by the arm (where the notes are!) and pulls her toward a table. The writing comes off in her hand.]</i>
<dt> <b>Matchmaker</b>: <dd> This way. Now, pour the tea. To please your future in-laws, you must demonstrate a sense of dignity <i>[she rubs her hand over her mouth, and the ink rubs off with a squeak]</i> and refinement. You must also be poised. <i>[Mulan, staring at the Matchmaker, pours the tea but misses the cup, then regains her composure and quickly fills the teacup.]</i>

Mulan notices Crickee relaxing happily in the tea. The Matchmaker takes the teacup.

The Matchmaker fights for the teacup, and they both fall back, the tea spilling all over the Matchmaker. Crickee hops down her dress.
</i>

<dl>
<dt> <b>Matchmaker</b>: <dd> Why, you clumsy! ... Oh! Ah! Woo! <i>[She trips over the fire-pot, spilling the coals and then sitting on them, the bottom of her dress smoking. Mulan desperately fans the burned spot, and it bursts into flames. The matchmaker runs around screaming.]</i>

  <dt> <b>Mulan</b>: <dd> Look at me ... I will never pass for a perfect bride<br>
       Or a perfect daughter<br>
       Can it be?<br>
       I'm not meant to play this part?<br>
       Now I see<br>
       That if I were truly to be myself<br>
       I would break my family's heart.<br>
       <p>
       Who is that girl I see<br>
       Staring straight back at me<br>
       Why is my reflection someone I don't know<br>
       Somehow I cannot hide<br>
       Who I am, though I've tried<br>
       When will my reflection show<br>
       Who I am inside?<br>
       When will my reflection show<br>
       Who I am, inside?

Mulan stares at her father for a moment, then runs outside crying.
<p>
Mulan is sitting in a statue of a dragon, crying. It is raining. Through the window of her house, she can see her mother and father talking. Fa Zhou picks up the candle and blows it out. Mulan thinks for a minute, then makes her decision.
<p>
Mulan walks into the Family Temple and lights a stick, placing it in a hanging statue of a small dragon. She runs into her parent's room, taking the scroll and leaving her hair comb. Taking her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and puts on her father's armor. Going out to the stable, she mounts Khan and sets off for the army.
<p>
The eyes of a statue in the temple flash, and Granny Fa wakes up.

<dt> <b>Mushu</b>: <dd> Just one chance. Is that too much to ask? I mean, it's not like it'll kill you.
<i>[To the dragon statue]</i> Yo, Rocky, wake up! You gotta go fetch Mulan! C'mon, boy! Go get her! Go on! C'mon!
