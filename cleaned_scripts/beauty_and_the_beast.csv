0,NARRATOR,"     Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a
              shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired,
              the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  But then, one
              winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and
              offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter
              cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at
              the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not
              to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.
              And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness
              melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.  The prince
              tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that
              there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she
              transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a
              powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there.
              Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself
              inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to
              the outside world.  The rose she had offered was truly an
              enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first
              year.  If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in
              return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would
              be broken.  If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for
              all time.  As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost
              all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast?

narration, as well as BEAST shredding his portrait.  The camera slowly zooms

curiosity overtakes her, and she turns back to the West Wing.  Her excitement
begins to dwindle, though, when she enters the hallway leading to BEAST's lair.
As she walks down the hall, she stops to look in a mirror that has been
shattered into several pieces, each one reflecting her concerned look.  She
reaches the end of the hall and finds a closed door with gargoyle handles.  She
takes a deep breath, then reaches out and opens the door.  Cut to int of lair,
where BELLE begins to explore.  She is truly shocked by everything she sees.

it crashes to the floor.  She then turns her head and sees a shredded picture
on
the wall.  We can only see part of a portrait.  It is the same portrait that
was
shredded in the opening. BELLE reaches out and lifts the shreds of the picture
to reveal the prince.  We never see this, however, for then she turns her head
and sees the rose under the bell jar.  She walks over to it, her eyes
transfixed.  She reaches out, then lifts off the jar, leaving the rose
unprotected.  She reaches up, brushes back the strand of hair that has been
repeatedly falling on her forehead, then reaches out to touch the rose.  As she
nears it, a shadow falls over her.  BEAST has been on the balcony, and sees
her.

stop.  She looks up and sees the WOLVES.  She gasps, then pulls the reins and
begins to flee.  She runs from side to side, making the WOLVES hit the trees (a
la Speederbike chase in Return of the Jedi).  PHILLIPE runs out on a frozen
pond, but his and BELLE's weight collapse the ice.  The WOLVES chase her into
the water.  Some begin to drown, but PHILLIPE is able to get out of the water
before anything serious happens.  He runs into a clearing, but becomes
surrounded by WOLVES.  He bucks, throwing BELLE off and wrapping the reins
around a tree branch.  The WOLVES begin their attack on PHILLIPE, but BELLE
comes to his rescue and beats them away with a stick.  One WOLF grabs the stick
in its mouth and breaks half of it off, leaving BELLE defenseless.  Another
leaps at her, grabbing the corner of her cloak and dragging her to the ground.
She looks up and sees a WOLF about to jump on top of her.  It leaps and is
caught in mid-air by BEAST.    He throws the WOLF away, then stands behind them
and BELLE.  They lunge at each other.  One rips a hole in BEAST's shoulder, and
the others focus their attack on that spot.  Finally, BEAST throws a WOLF
against a tree, knocking it out.  The others turn and run in fear.  BEAST turns
back to BELLE, looks at her despairingly, then collapses.  BELLE, grateful to
be
alive, turns back to PHILLIPE and begins to get on, but her conscience takes
over, and she walks over to the fallen BEAST.  Fade to BELLE and PHILLIPE

(LUMIERE tries to respond, but BELLE slams the door behind her.  He and
COGSWORTH both bow their heads in sadness.  Cut to BELLE outside in the forest
on PHILLIPE.  She begins to ride through the forest, but PHILLIPE comes to a
stop.  She looks up and sees the WOLVES.  She gasps, then pulls the reins and
begins to flee.  She runs from side to side, making the WOLVES hit the trees (a
la Speederbike chase in Return of the Jedi).  PHILLIPE runs out on a frozen
pond, but his and BELLE's weight collapse the ice.  The WOLVES chase her into
the water.  Some begin to drown, but PHILLIPE is able to get out of the water
before anything serious happens.  He runs into a clearing, but becomes
surrounded by WOLVES.  He bucks, throwing BELLE off and wrapping the reins
around a tree branch.  The WOLVES begin their attack on PHILLIPE, but BELLE
comes to his rescue and beats them away with a stick.  One WOLF grabs the stick
in its mouth and breaks half of it off, leaving BELLE defenseless.  Another
leaps at her, grabbing the corner of her cloak and dragging her to the ground.
She looks up and sees a WOLF about to jump on top of her.  It leaps and is
caught in mid-air by BEAST.    He throws the WOLF away, then stands behind them
and BELLE.  They lunge at each other.  One rips a hole in BEAST's shoulder, and
the others focus their attack on that spot.  Finally, BEAST throws a WOLF
against a tree, knocking it out.  The others turn and run in fear.  BEAST turns
back to BELLE, looks at her despairingly, then collapses.  BELLE, grateful to
be
alive, turns back to PHILLIPE and begins to get on, but her conscience takes
over, and she walks over to the fallen BEAST.  Fade to BELLE and PHILLIPE
walking back to the castle, with BEAST on the horse's back.  Fade to int of
den,
with BELLE pouring hot water out of MRS. POTTS.  She soaks a rag in the water,
then turns to BEAST, who is licking his wounds.)
