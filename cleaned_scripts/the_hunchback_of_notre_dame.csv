(He swings his cape, covering Quasi's head.  But as he tries to throw
Quasi off the balcony, the panicking Quasi pulls Frollo off as well.
Now Frollo is hanging onto Quasi, who is hanging onto Esmeralda.  Frollo
throws his cape around another gargoyle, and pulls himself over.  He
stands up and is about to swing at Esmeralda.)

(The gargoyle, however, begins to crack.  Frollo is thrown off balance,
and hangs onto the gargoyle's head.  Suddenly, the 'goyle comes to life
and roars.  Frollo screams, and the now stone gargoyle breaks off,
sending Frollo falling to his death.  Meanwhile, Esmeralda is losing her
grip on Quasimodo.)

(He falls right along the building, close enough for Phoebus to catch
him several floors below and pull him back into the building.  When
Quasi sees who has caught him, he and Phoebus hug.  Esmeralda comes
running in.  After Esmeralda hugs him, he takes Esmeralda's hand and
Phoebus' hand, and puts them together.  They kiss, and Quasi smiles
broadly.   Cut to ground level, where Phoebus and Esmeralda emerge into
the light.  As the crowd cheers, Esmeralda turns back to the open
doorway.  She comes back and leads out Quasimodo.  The crowd goes
silent.  Soon, a little girl cautiously comes forward from the crowd.
She looks at him, then pets his face.  They then hug, and Quasi picks
her up and put her up on his shoulder.  The crowd begins to cheer.  As
he moves into the crowd, they do not move away as before.  The 'goyles
are above, breaking out the champagne.)
