1,PEDDLER,"    Oh I come from a land
    From a faraway place
    Where the caravan camels roam
    Where they cut off your ear /Where it's flat and immense
    If they don't like your face /And the heat is intense
    It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!
    When the wind's at your back
    And the sun's from the west
    And the sand in the glass is right
    Come on down,
    Stop on by
    Hop a carpet and fly
    To another Arabian night!

    Arabian nights
    Like Arabian days
    More often than not
    Are hotter than hot
    In a lot of good ways

    Arabian nights
    'Neath Arabian moons
    A fool off his guard
    Could fall and fall hard
    Out there on the dunes.

    Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend.
    Please, please, come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting
    peddler in face) Too close, a little too close.  (Camera
    zooms back out to CU)There.Welcome to Agrabah.  City of
    mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this
    side of the river Jordan, on sale today, come on down!
    Heh, heh.  Look at this! Yes!  Combination hookah and
    coffee maker--also makes Julienne fries.  Will not break
    (taps it on table), will not--(it falls apart)--it
    broke.  Ooohhh!  Look at this! Pulls out Tupperware) I
    have never seen one of these intact before.  This is the
    famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.  (Pries it open,
    makes raspberry sound.)  Ah, still good. (Camera begins
    to pan to right.  PEDDLER hurries to catch it.)  Wait,
    don't go!  (Stop pan.)I can see that you're only
    interested in the exceptionally rare.  I think then, you
    would be most rewarded to consider...this.  (PEDDLER
    pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve.) Do not be
    fooled by its commonplace appearance.  Like so many
    things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside
    that counts.  (Another pan, this one slower to left.
    Again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.)  This is no ordinary
    lamp!  It once changed the course of a young man's life.
    A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he
    seemed.  A diamond in the rough.  Perhaps you would like
    to hear the tale?  (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the
    lamp into his hand.)  It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER
    throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry
    nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a dark
    purpose.

(Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
    on his shoulder.  GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair.)

    You ain't never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,
    but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes
     into four duplicate GENIEs.)

    Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
    You're the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish
    How about a little more Baklava?

(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure
    and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the
    screen with baklava.)

    You ain't never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top,
    then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off
    and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth,
    and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE
     dressed like a magician comes out.)

(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant
    hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish
    him into nothing.)

    Do your friends do that?
    Do your friends pull this out their little hat
    Can your friends go poof!
    Well looky here
    Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip
    And then make the sucker disappear?

(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
    He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
    one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses
     the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull
     himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around
     until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into
    a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them,
     they disappear.)

    So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
    I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
    You got me bona fide, certified
    You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs!
    I got a powerful urge to help you out
    So what you wish I really want to know
    You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt
    So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh!


(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a
    certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls
     a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses
    to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.)

    Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
    I'm on the job, you big nabob
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me!
    You ain't never had a friend like me!

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one.
     She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into
    existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels,
     and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold
     as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and
    zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a
    neon ""APPLAUSE"" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and
    sees that is is empty.)

",1133,"(Music for ""Friend Like Me"" begins)","    Master, I don't
        think you quite realize what you've got here! So
        why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate
        the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a
        fluorescent light)

    Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
    Scheherazadie had a thousand tales
    But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve
    You got a brand of magic never fails!

(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes
    the thieves into submission.)

    You got some power in your corner now
    Some heavy ammunition in your camp
    You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
    See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
    And I'll say

(Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged
    by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and
    explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's
     hand and rubs lamp with it.)

    Mister Aladdin sir
    What will your pleasure be?
    Let me take your order, jot it down
    You ain't never had a friend like me
    No no no!

(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a
    note pad, like a waiter. )

    Life is your restaurant
    And I'm your maitre' d!
    C'mon whisper what it is you want
    You ain't never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,
    but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes
     into four duplicate GENIEs.)

    Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
    You're the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish
    How about a little more Baklava?

(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure
    and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the
    screen with baklava.)

    Try some of column 'A'
    Try all of column 'B'
    I'm in the mood to help you dude
    You ain't never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top,
    then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off
    and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth,
    and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE
     dressed like a magician comes out.)

(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant
    hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish
    him into nothing.)

    Can your friends do this?
    Do your friends do that?
    Do your friends pull this out their little hat
    Can your friends go poof!
    Well looky here
    Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip
    And then make the sucker disappear?

(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
    He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
    one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses
     the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull
     himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around
     until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into
    a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them,
     they disappear.)
